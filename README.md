# Build a Computer from First Principles - From Nand to Tetris

### Instructors: Shimon Schocken, Noam Nisan (HUJ)

This is a project based coursed on Coursera that teaches computer architecture by building everything hierarchically starting from just a Nand Gate.

### How to run
1. Download Nand2tetris software suite from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9c0BdDJz6XpZUh3X2dPR1o0MUE).
2. Ensure that you have a working Java version by typing `java --version` from Terminal. If it is not installed,
then install Java from [here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
3. You should now be able to run the emulators by running `*.sh` files in `tools` directory. If necessary,
make these `*.sh` files executable by running `chmod +x *.sh`
4. Copy the `tools` directory to the root of the directory where you cloned this repository to run things faster.

<!-- ### Perspectives:
Though I work in machine learning and specifically in computer vision research area, I have a non-CS college degree. I learned programming on my own and I use it daily for my work. However I always wanted to know internal workings of computer. So I took this course as  a hobby. At the end of part 1, I am reasonably happy with my understanding. Here are the things I learnt:
- Building chips from Nand to Computer with several in between, Or,Xor,And,Mux,DMux,Bit,Register,RAM,Memory,CPU,Computer
- Assembly language
- Built an assembler in java to convert assembly to machine language.
Looking forward to part 2 of the course to learn about further layers of abstraction. -->
