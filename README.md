# Build a Computer from First Principles - From Nand to Tetris

### Teachers: Shimon Schocken, Noam Nisan (HUJ)

This is a project based coursed on Coursera that teaches computer architecture by building everything hierarchically starting from just a Nand Gate.

### How to run
1. Download Nand2tetris software suite from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9c0BdDJz6XpZUh3X2dPR1o0MUE).
2. Ensure that you have a working Java version by typing `java --version` from Terminal. If it is not installed,
then install Java from [here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
3. You should now be able to run the emulators by running `*.sh` files in `tools` directory. If necessary,
make these `*.sh` files executable by running `chmod +x *.sh`
4. Copy the `tools` directory to the root of the directory where you cloned this repository to run things faster.
